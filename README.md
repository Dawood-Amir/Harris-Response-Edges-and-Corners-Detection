# Harris-response-Edges-and-Corners-Detection

**1. Harris Corner Response Computation:

Goal: Calculate the Harris response RR for each pixel in an image, which helps in detecting corners.
Steps:
    Compute the image gradients in the x and y directions using the Sobel operator.
    Calculate the auto-correlation matrix components Ixx,Iyy,IxyIxx​,Iyy​,Ixy​.
    Apply Gaussian smoothing to these components to obtain matrices A,B,CA,B,C.
    Use these matrices to compute the Harris response R=Det(T)−k⋅(Trace(T))2R=Det(T)−k⋅(Trace(T))2, where TT is the structure tensor.
Corner Detection:

Goal: Identify corner points in the image where the Harris response is high. Steps: Shift the Harris response image to create images representing the 8 neighbors around each pixel. Identify pixels that are local maxima within their 3x3 neighborhood and have a response value above a certain threshold. These pixels are marked as corners.

Edge Detection:

Goal: Detect edges by identifying pixels that are local minima along the x or y axis in the Harris response image. Steps: Shift the Harris response image to create images representing the neighbors along the x and y axes (left-right, up-down). Compare each pixel to its neighbors to find local minima along these axes. Mark pixels as edges if they are local minima and have a response value below a threshold.

Key Concepts:

Shifting: Used to create neighbor images for efficient, vectorized comparisons without loops.
Thresholding: Ensures only significant corners and edges are detected, filtering out noise.
Vectorization: Leveraging numpy operations to perform comparisons and computations across the entire image efficiently.
